# Project 25

## Overview
A collection of 25 games from my childhood that I built using vanilla JavaScript.

I like playing games and I hate black bloxes! So, I made some classic games that I grew up with on and off the screen from scratch.

## Preview
<table align="center">
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="/img/preview/pong.jpg" width="300px">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="/img/preview/snake.jpg" width="300px">
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="/img/preview/game-2048.jpg" width="300px">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
